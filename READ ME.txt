=============

Implementation of Ford's distributed algorithm

Write a program using C++ or Java to implement Ford's distributed algroithm. 
You randomly generate a graph and the weights on the edges, and randomly pick 
a source and a destination, and then apply Ford's distributed algorithm to 
find the shortest path from the source to the destination. Print out the graph 
(the vertices, edges and their weights), source, destination, and the shortest 
path from the source to the destination.

Sample Output:
=============
Enter the number of Nodes: 5
Printing The Adjacency Matrix: 
	0	8	4	9	4

	8	0	3	5	9

	4	3	0	3	9

	9	5	3	0	5

	4	9	9	5	0


Printing Graph:

(1->1) : 0	(1->2) : 8	(1->3) : 4	(1->4) : 9	(1->5) : 4	

(2->1) : 8	(2->2) : 0	(2->3) : 3	(2->4) : 5	(2->5) : 9	

(3->1) : 4	(3->2) : 3	(3->3) : 0	(3->4) : 3	(3->5) : 9	

(4->1) : 9	(4->2) : 5	(4->3) : 3	(4->4) : 0	(4->5) : 5	

(5->1) : 4	(5->2) : 9	(5->3) : 9	(5->4) : 5	(5->5) : 0	

Generating source randomly: 
Source: 2
Generating destination randomly: 
Destination: 5

Shortest Distances From Source To All Nodes Are:

distance of source  2 to 1 is 7
distance of source  2 to 2 is 0
distance of source  2 to 3 is 3
distance of source  2 to 4 is 5
distance of source  2 to 5 is 9

Shortest Dist from 2 to Dest 5 : 9
